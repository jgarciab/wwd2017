    "# 6 Statistics I\n",
    "To learn about statistics *well*, I recommend this course: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/social-science\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.0 Definitions\n",
    "### 6.0.1 Population vs sample\n",
    "- Population: The entire set of possible observations (all people in a country in a country-level survey)\n",
    "- Sample: The observations we actually have\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 6.0.2 Parameter vs statistic\n",
    "- Parameter: The true values that define the population ($\\sigma$ and $\\mu$ for a normal distribution)\n",
    "- Statistic: The values that we calculate using our sample (STD and MEAN for a normal distribution)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 6.0.3 Probability\n",
    "- Probability: The proportion of times where the measured event occurs in the long run. \n",
    "- For instance, the probability of a coin toss is 0.5, which means that if you toss a coin 1 million times you will more or less get 500k heads and 500k tails)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.0.4 Null hypothesis:\n",
    "- The hypothesis that our value is not significant.\n",
    "- For instance our value can be the difference between two groups, or the difference between one group and zero.\n",
    "- It is assumed to be true and we try to disprove it.\n",
    "- It is \"disproved\" if the chances to dismiss it by chance are lower than 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.0.5 Alternative hypothesis:\n",
    "- The hypothesis that our value is significant.\n",
    "- Accepted after dismissing the null hypothesis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 6.0.6 Types of error:\n",
    "- Type I ($\\alpha$): Rejecting the null hypothesis when it was actually True (saying we have something we don't have). As a rule we set it to 0.05 and if the p-value is below it we accept the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "- Type II ($\\beta$): Accepting the null hypothesis when it was actually False (saying we don't have something we actually have). This is a less important error.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 6.0.7 p-value\n",
    "- The p-value is defined as the probability of obtaining a result equal to or \"more extreme\" than what was actually observed, **when the null hypothesis is true.**\n",
    "- \"commonly misused and misinterpreted.\" --> a p-value of 0.01 does not mean that there is 1% chances that you are wrong!\n",
    "- Low p-value can be for two reasons:\n",
    "    - The null is true but your sample was unusual.\n",
    "    - The null is false.\n",
    "- with a p-value of 0.05 the probability of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis is 23% (mainly for other bias).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.0.8 Confidence intervals\n",
    "- The likely range of values where the value of a parameter lies within. \n",
    "- It depends on your significance level (usually 0.05)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 6.0.9 Effect size:\n",
    "- Difference between the difference of the two groups (of the one group with zero) divided by the standard deviation. \n",
    "- Show the confidence intervals.\n",
    "- Good summary: https://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/00002182.htm\n",
    "- \"For example, an AIDS vaccine study in Thailand obtained a P value of 0.039. Great! This was the first time that an AIDS vaccine had positive results. However, the confidence interval for effectiveness ranged from 1% to 52%. That’s not so impressive...the vaccine may work virtually none of the time up to half the time. The effectiveness is both low and imprecisely estimated.\" quote: http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/five-guidelines-for-using-p-values\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.0.10 Correlation\n",
    "- Dependence or association is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or two sets of data. Correlation is any of a broad class of statistical relationships involving dependence, though in common usage it most often refers to the extent to which two variables have a linear relationship with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.0.11 In general:\n",
    "- Larger population: We can detect smaller differences.\n",
    "- Smaller variability within groups: We can detect smaller differences.\n",
    "- Large differences between groups (effect size): Unlikely that it is due to noise.\n",

    "## 6.1 Biases \n",
    "### 6.1.1 Cherry-picking (yourself)\n",
    "- Using individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position, while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position.\n",
    "- Cherry picking may be committed intentionally or unintentionally. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.2 Look-elsewhere effect (sample size)\n",
    "- If you try many things, one will be significant.\n",
    "- **With a sample size large enough, any outrageous thing is likely to happen** (Persi Diaconis and Frederick Mosteller) \n",
    "- If you have a database, scan the values to see if there is something interesting, and then use that you are cheating. Your minimum p-value shouldn't be 0.05, should be 0.05/(variables scanned before hand)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.3 Optional stopping (data collection)\n",
    "- It is a well-known fact of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) that when there is \"optional stopping\" of data collection with testing at every new datum (a procedure also called \"sequential testing\" or \"data peeking\"), then the null hypothesis will eventually be rejected even when it is true. With enough random sampling from the null hypothesis, eventually there will be some accidental coincidence of outlying values so that p < .05 (conditionalizing on the current sample size). Anscombe (1954) called this phenomenon, \"sampling to reach a foregone conclusion.\" from; http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.nl/2013/11/optional-stopping-in-data-collection-p.html"
