<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, one of the most important events on a prospective Republican presidential candidate's calendar was the RedState Gathering, a summer convention for conservative activists from across the nation. Its host was Erick Erickson, a round-faced, redheaded former election lawyer and city councilman in Macon, Ga., who began blogging in 2004 on a site called RedState.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erickson, who is now 41, is a conservative absolutist who made his name in the mid-2000s by ''blowing up'' -- in the Twitter parlance he jovially employs -- Republican leaders he viewed as insufficiently principled. In 2005, he played a role in torpedoing the Supreme Court nomination of the White House counsel Harriet Miers, publishing damaging admissions from White House sources that Miers had not been properly vetted. Five years later, he chided the National Rifle Association for being too willing to compromise, labeling it ''a weak little girl of an organization.'' He was a sharp-tongued critic of John McCain and Mitt Romney during their presidential runs, characterizing the former as ''an angry old jackass'' and the latter as ''the Harriet Miers of 2012.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Along the way, Erickson became one of the new kingmakers of the Tea Party-era G.O.P. A little-known Florida legislator and Senate hopeful named Marco Rubio reached out to him in 2009 when he was at 3 percent in the polls. A former Texas solicitor general, Ted Cruz, did the same in 2011. Rick Perry announced his 2012 presidential candidacy at Erickson's gathering. By 2015, a number of the coming cycle's aspirants -- Rubio, Cruz, Perry and Bobby Jindal -- had given him their personal cellphone numbers, and he had traded emails with Jeb Bush. And two months before that August's convention in Atlanta, a New York-based Republican consultant named Sam Nunberg reached out to Erickson to ask if he could accommodate one more speaker: Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Erickson watched coverage of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stream-of-consciousness announcement at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower on June 16 and was not particularly impressed. On the syndicated radio show he broadcasts from Atlanta, he offered his assessment with a dismissive chuckle: ''I guess he's ready to be spoiler, not president.'' He had met </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> once before, in July 2011, when he visited the 26th floor of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower to interview the businessman and reality-TV-show star. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had spent the past few months flirting with a presidential run only to decide, as he told Erickson that day, ''I have a great show that's a big success, and it's hard to say, 'I'm gonna leave two hours of prime-time television in order to get beat up by people that don't know what they're doing.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The hourlong conversation struck Erickson as pleasant but unmemorable. What did stick with him was their exchange as he was leaving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked me if I played golf,'' Erickson told me recently. ''And I said, 'Yeah, I'm terrible.' '' Then, he said, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked if he would be interested in coming to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> golf-club in West Palm Beach, Fla., to play. ''I'm very flattered -- I've never been to West Palm Beach before,'' Erickson recalled. ''Several times, his office reached out. So finally I asked my wife, 'What do you think this is about?' She said, 'He wants to own your soul.' So I never went.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Erickson did not see much of a political future for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but he imagined that he might be good for ticket sales, if nothing else, at the RedState Gathering. He informed Nunberg that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could have a slot on the convention's second day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The evening before he was to speak in Atlanta, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> went on CNN and denounced the Fox News host Megyn Kelly for her sharp questioning of him during a recent debate, speculating that Kelly had ''blood coming out of her wherever.'' When Erickson saw the footage that evening, he called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and rescinded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> invitation on the grounds that he would be too much of a distraction. ''And that was that,'' Erickson would later recall with a sheepish grin. ''Until the next day, when he's blowing me up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Twitter, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called Erickson ''a major sleaze and buffoon'' and said that the ''small crowds'' at the gathering were due to his absence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters soon piled on. This was to be expected, but what surprised Erickson were the attacks from people he regarded as his fellow bomb-throwers in the conservative revolution. On Twitter, the talk-radio host and Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham mocked ''JebState.'' The author and right-wing provocateur Ann Coulter brought up some of Erickson's own crass utterances, like his characterization of the former Supreme Court justice David Souter in 2009 as a ''goat-[expletive] child molester.'' The next week, 30,000 readers of Erickson's email newsletter canceled their subscriptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Erickson dug in, writing that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was ''out of his depth'' and lacking in ''common decency.'' But he was drowned out by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sympathizers with even bigger audiences than his own, like The Drudge Report and the online outlet Breitbart. It was one of the first salvos in what would open up in the year that followed into a civil war within the conservative media, dividing some of the loudest voices on the right. Days earlier, Erickson had unimpeachable credentials in the conservative movement. But by crossing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he was now, in the eyes of his former allies, ''a tool of the establishment.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The conservative media has always been a playground for outsize personalities with even more outsize political ambitions. The National Review founder William F. Buckley fashioned much of the intellectual genetic code of the Reagan Revolution, while also writing fringe groups like the John Birch Society out of the conservative movement and, for good measure, running for mayor of New York against the liberal Republican John Lindsay. In 1996, the former Nixon media consultant Roger Ailes brought his attack-dog ethos to Rupert Murdoch's Fox News channel and built the network into a transformational power in Republican politics before his fall this year amid accusations of sexual harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But alongside the institution-builders like Buckley and Ailes, the conservative-media landscape has also produced a class of rowdy entrepreneurs who wield their influence in more personal, protean ways. The godfathers mostly came to power in the 1990s: Clinton-administration antagonists like Rush Limbaugh, who began broadcasting nationally in 1988 and became talk radio's hegemonic power in the Clinton years, and Matt Drudge, who started his pioneering Drudge Report online in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If these figures defied the stuffy ceremony of the East Coast think tanks, opinion journals and bow-tied columnists who traditionally defined the conservative intelligentsia, they rarely challenged the ideological principles of conservatism as they had existed since the Reagan era: small government, low taxes, hawkish foreign policy and traditional social values. What they mostly did was provide the Republican Party with a set of exceptionally loud megaphones, which liberals have often envied and tried unsuccessfully to emulate. Conservative talk radio and Fox News now collectively reach an audience of as many as 50 million -- most of them elderly white Republicans with a high likelihood of turning out in election years. And this isn't even counting the like-minded online outlets that have flourished during the Obama years, thanks to a growing internet-media economy and a presidency, particularly in the case of the Affordable Care Act, that gave conservatives common cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then came </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. In a sense, the divide that he has opened up among conservative media figures is simply a function of the heartburn his ascent has caused among Republicans more generally, pitting voter against voter, congressman against congressman, Bob Dole against the Bushes. Some conservative media outlets threw themselves behind </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the beginning, explaining away his more radioactive statements and his uneven-at-best record as a conservative. Breitbart, whose former chairman, Steve Bannon, is now </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief strategist, was an ardent early supporter, breathlessly covering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ascent in the polls and his smackdowns of ''low energy'' Jeb Bush and ''little Marco'' Rubio. But as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> expanded into more sacrosanct targets -- Fox News's Kelly, George W. Bush's performance in the war on terror and Cruz -- the dissenting chorus among conservatism's dons grew louder. The Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer warned in December that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''has managed to steer the entire G.O.P. campaign into absurdities.'' His Post colleague George Will predicted that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nomination would mean the loss of conservatism ''as a constant presence in U.S. politics.'' The Weekly Standard editor William Kristol floated the idea of a new ''non-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> non-Clinton party.'' And on the eve of the Iowa caucus, National Review devoted an entire issue to a single topic: ''Against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> clinched the nomination, the dividing lines have become starker, the individual dilemmas more agonizing. Mark Levin, an influential talk-radio host, complains that among conservative commentators, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> message is endlessly repeated by what he derisively refers to as ''the Rockettes.'' But Levin, too, recently announced to his listeners that he intends to vote for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, if only to prevent another Clinton presidency. As he put it to me, ''I'm not going to be throwing confetti in the air if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wins,'' adding that he viewed the candidate as ''a liberal with some conservative viewpoints that he's not terribly reliable at sticking to.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others -- Sean Hannity, Ingraham, the former Reagan official and ''The Book of Virtues'' author William Bennett -- have thrown in for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a brio that strikes some in the business as unseemly. ''Look, we're in the opinion business, but there's a distinction between that and being a Sean Hannity fanboy,'' the Milwaukee-based talk-radio host Charlie Sykes told me. ''It's been genuinely stunning to watch how they've become tools of his campaign and rationalizing everything he's done.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For 20 years I've been saying how it's not true that talk radio is all about ratings and we don't believe what we say,'' he went on. ''Then you watch how the media types rolled over for him. Obviously Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is very good for ratings, and at some point it's hard not to conclude they decided the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> train was the gravy train. I've been thoroughly disillusioned, and I'm not alone in that. It's like watching 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers': Oh, my God, they got another one!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declared his candidacy in June 2015, the part of his announcement speech that most clearly foreshadowed the campaign to come had to do with immigration. ''When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,'' he told the crowd at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower. ''They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The line struck Sykes as awfully familiar when he heard it. A month before, he had run a segment with Ann Coulter, who had just published her 11th book, an anti-immigration screed titled ''&iexcl;Adios, America!'' Sykes was well aware of Coulter's views, but he was taken aback when she began a riff on Mexican rapists surging into the United States (a subject that takes up an entire chapter of ''&iexcl;Adios, America!''). ''I remember looking at my producer and going, 'Wow, this is rather extraordinary,' '' he told me. ''When </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used that line, I instantly recognized it as Ann Coulter's.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, Corey Lewandowski had reached out to Coulter for advice in the run-up to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announcement speech. The address </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> delivered on June 16 bore no resemblance to his prepared text, which contained a mere two sentences about immigration. Instead, he ad-libbed what Coulter today calls ''the Mexican rapist speech that won my heart.'' When </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remarks provoked fury, Lewandowski called Coulter for backup. Three days later, she went on HBO's ''Real Time With Bill Maher'' and, amid shrieks of laughter from the audience, predicted that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the Republican candidate most likely to win the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One evening this past March, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> received Coulter at Mar-a-Lago, his estate-turned-club in Palm Beach. Though in recent years the two had developed a rapport on Twitter, she had met him face to face only once before he declared his candidacy, a lunch date at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in 2011. Over lunch, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gave Coulter the impression that he had read her books. He also gave her a few items from his wife's line of costume jewelry and told Coulter, who keeps a house in Palm Beach, that she was welcome to use the pool at Mar-a-Lago anytime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The golf resort was the chief staging ground for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> charm offensives against the conservative media. Many of its members have visited at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> invitation in recent years, joining the resident Gatsby for steak and lobster on the patio, where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> squints and appears to listen intently while his guests dispense political wisdom -- though it is never clear whether he is actually interested in it, simply flattering his guests or sizing them up. When I dined with him on the patio this spring, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked me eagerly about how I liked his odds in the election. Later, on the campaign trail, I watched him solicit the same counsel from random stragglers on the rope line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Coulter, at any rate, appeared immune to the whole routine. A week earlier, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bragged during a Republican presidential debate in Detroit that ''there's no problem'' with the size of his penis. On the patio, Coulter told the candidate that no one wanted to hear about his endowment. She told Lewandowski that he should buy a dozen teleprompters and put them in every room of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> house until he learned how to use them. Reminding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that she had been his earliest and most dedicated advocate, she told him: ''I'm the only one losing money trying to put you in the White House. You're going to listen to me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This appeal to the bottom line seemed to tweak </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conscience. He gave Coulter an open invitation to Mar-a-Lago, waiving the $100,000 membership fee. The following evening at the next Republican debate, he exhibited considerably more restraint, for which Coulter, with characteristic modesty, claims credit. ''Coulter delivers!'' she told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters within the conservative media are attracted to his actual positions on issues. One is his trade policy, on which many media personalities on the right are considerably more populist and protectionist than Republican Party leaders and Chamber of Commerce boosters. Throughout Obama's presidency, Laura Ingraham has warned of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> predations: ''The trade war is on, and we're losing it,'' she has often said. For others, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> assurance that he will appoint Antonin Scalia-like conservatives to the Supreme Court is reason enough for their support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also simply fulfills the ineffable urge many have to, as Michael Needham, the chief executive of the conservative policy group Heritage Action for America, puts it, ''punch Washington in the face.'' This is true for Coulter, who, in her newly published paean to the candidate, ''In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We Trust,'' writes that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is fit for the presidency not in spite of his crudeness but because of it: ''Only someone who brags about his airline's seatbelt buckles being made of solid gold would have the balls to do what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is doing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But what really sold Coulter on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, she told me, was his hard line on immigration. Coulter told me that she had never given the issue much thought during her childhood in New Canaan, Conn., and her student days at Cornell. Then in 1992, the British-American journalist Peter Brimelow wrote a 14,000-word essay for National Review titled ''Time to Rethink Immigration?'' which would later become a sort of ur-text for today's alt-right, the ascendant white-nationalist movement that has found its champion in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Brimelow cast the current wave of American immigrants in dismal terms: less skilled, less European, less assimilated, less law-abiding and less Republican than the previous newcomers. Coulter, who was 31 and a law clerk at the time, remembers reading it and thinking, ''Oh, my gosh, I've been completely lied to!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Twenty-four years later, Coulter helped formulate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> immigration-policy position, which she hailed on Twitter as ''the greatest political document since the Magna Carta.'' (Her additional tweet on the subject -- ''I don't care if @realDonaldTrump wants to perform abortions in the White House after this immigration policy paper'' -- prompted Mark Levin to tweet back, ''These have to be among the most pathetic comments of anyone in a long time.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Coulter has not always gotten her way with the candidate. At Mar-a-Lago that evening in March, she lobbied unsuccessfully for him to pick as his running mate Kris Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas, who is credited with selling Mitt Romney on ''self-deportation.'' And her book tour for ''In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We Trust'' hit a momentary snag when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told Sean Hannity that he would be open to ''softening'' his immigration stance, though Coulter chose to believe that, as she told me, ''it was Hannity badgering him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, she has become the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign's most unrepentant brawler. When Khzir Khan, the Pakistani-American father of a U.S. Army captain who was killed in combat in Iraq, spoke critically of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the Democratic National Convention, Coulter wrote on Twitter: ''You know what this convention really needed: An angry Muslim with a thick accent like Fareed Zacaria[sic].''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That tweet provoked disgust from fellow conservatives, among them Erick Erickson, who tweeted: ''What a terrible thing to say about a man whose son died for this country.'' When I reminded Coulter of Erickson's scolding, she let out a hearty laugh. ''I always hated him,'' she said. ''This is one of the fantastic things. In any political movement, there are many people you think are losers and dorks, but your friends talk you into liking them, because they're on our side. Now all of those people are out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sighing, she said, ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has made my life better in so many ways.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You will not find copies of ''&iexcl;Adios, America!'' or ''In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We Trust'' on any of the many bookshelves in the home of the Washington Post columnist George Will. A week after Ted Cruz dropped out of the Republican presidential race in early May, Will and his wife, Mari, a Republican political consultant, gave a catered dinner party for Cruz and his wife, Heidi. The other guests were conservative donors, activists and journalists, along with their spouses. The Wills have been hosting these off-the-record encounters with political celebrities at their Maryland home for decades. In early 2009, Will's fellow conservative columnists gathered there to meet Obama a week before his inauguration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among the guests that evening in May was Laura Ingraham. Ingraham is of proudly working-class heritage -- her mother was a waitress for almost 30 years and her father owned and operated a Coin-a-Matic carwash -- and does not share Will's reverence for decorum. She was an early defender of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> willingness to say things ''no one else is saying.'' While interviewing Cruz on her radio show six weeks before the Wills' party, she interrupted him to mock his Harvard Law degree. Still, Cruz knew that his political future relied on conservative opinion-makers like Ingraham, and it was at his request that the Wills included her in the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over cocktails, the Cruzes spoke fondly of their experiences on the campaign trail, and the other guests listened politely, mindful of Cruz's recent humiliating defeat. Then midway through dinner, at a table set with glasses once used by Abraham Lincoln, Ingraham insisted that Cruz needed to throw his weight behind the man who had branded him ''Lyin' Ted.'' ''If you don't endorse him, where does that leave you?'' she said. ''You don't have the public and you don't have the establishment. How can you be a leader of the conservative movement?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz amiably replied that such a decision did not have to be made right away. Others at the table joined in to defend him, but Ingraham would hear nothing of it. ''You can't want Hillary Clinton elected,'' she goaded him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Will sat fuming silently. ''She was quite animated,'' he would later recall. Cruz refused to offer his support to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that night or in the weeks to follow. Speaking at the Republican convention on July 20 moments before Cruz was to do the same, Ingraham taunted him: ''We should all, even all you boys with wounded feelings and bruised egos -- and we love you, we love you -- but you must honor the pledge to support Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> now, tonight!'' The following morning on her radio show, Ingraham declared that Cruz's refusal to endorse had ''effectively ended his political career.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Will was no more persuaded by Ingraham than Cruz was. The first and only time Will met </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was in March 1995, when, at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> invitation, he gave a speech at Mar-a-Lago. Years later on Twitter, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would ascribe Will's harsh view of him to Will's having ''totally bombed'' with his performance that night. Will told me: ''He started telling this story: 'The reason Will doesn't like me is I invited him to give a speech at Mar-a-Lago, and I knew it was going to be boring, so I waited out on the patio.' Which raises two questions. First, if he knew it was going to be that boring, why did he invite me? And second, who would be the guy with the orange hair sitting in the front row?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Will said on ABC's ''This Week'' in 2012 that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was ''a bloviating ignoramus'' and he has spent much of the past year predicting the candidate's imminent political demise. ''I thought even an entertaining bore could be a bore after a while,'' he told me. By late December of last year, however, his contempt had given way to alarm. ''Conservatives' highest priority,'' he wrote in a Post column, ''must be to prevent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from winning the Republican nomination'' -- even if it meant Hillary Clinton's election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then on June 2, three weeks after his dinner party for Cruz, Will learned that his friend and fellow Republican Paul Ryan, the House speaker, had endorsed the nominee. Will considered the matter over martinis at home that evening. The next morning, he walked into his office and told his assistant: ''Go change my registration. This is not my party anymore.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Recently I visited Will at his office, a three-story Georgetown brick rowhouse erected in 1811. Its walls are covered with framed photographs, several of them depicting the writer in his youth alongside Reagan and other titans of his former party. The dean of conservative pundits, now 75, wore a crisp pinstripe shirt and gray slacks, his customary owlish Mona Lisa expression a bit tighter than usual, owing to the subject matter. Will told me that he cast his first vote in 1964, for Barry Goldwater. He voted for the Republican candidate in every succeeding presidential election, until now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't use the word 'frightening' often,'' he told me. ''But it's frightening to know this person'' -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- ''would have the nuclear-launch codes. The world is getting really dangerous. His friend Mr. Putin is dismantling a nation in the center of Europe. Some trigger-happy captain of a Chinese boat with ship-to-ship missiles might make a mistake in the next three years near the Spratly Islands. All kinds of things can go wrong. And the idea that this guy will be asked to respond in a sober, firm way? My goodness.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He seemed genuinely despondent. ''Given that, could you see yourself urging your readers to vote for Hillary Clinton?'' I asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Will's lips pursed slightly. ''Well,'' he said, ''it's clear from everything I've written that I think she'd be a better president. That said, I'm not going to vote for her. First of all, I'm a Maryland voter. She couldn't lose Maryland if she tried.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Then. ...''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I haven't decided,'' he said. ''You can imagine -- I get tons of emails: 'I, too, have left the Republican Party. What should I do?' Well, there are a number of legitimate options. Not voting is a legitimate expression of opinion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ingraham and other conservative media personalities hailed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for having ''tapped into'' a shared and seething disquiet among predominantly white, non-college-educated voters. ''What I don't understand on the part of those being tapped into,'' Will told me, ''is: What exactly do they want? I can think of nothing the American people have wanted intensely and protractedly that they didn't get. Took a while, but they got it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With a resigned half-smirk, he looked at the ground and intoned, in the manner of a hostage-video monologue: ''It's gonna be yuge. And it's all gonna get fixed. And we're all gonna be winners.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If he doesn't build that wall, I'm pissed,'' Sean Hannity told me, reflecting on the prospects of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency in the office of his radio show in Midtown Manhattan. ''If he doesn't repeal Obamacare, I'm gonna be pissed. If he appoints a liberal jurist to the Supreme Court, I'm gonna lose my mind. And by the way: I'll be screaming. Not talking -- screaming about it. But in fairness, if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't keep his promises, you can also blame me, because I believed him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although Coulter was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> earliest cheerleader among prominent conservative-media personalities, Hannity's stake in the election perhaps runs deepest of all, if only because of the size of his audience. He hosts the second-highest-rated show (after Limbaugh) on talk radio and the third-highest-rated program (after Bill O'Reilly and Megyn Kelly) on cable news. More than 2.4 million weekly viewers and 13 million listeners have witnessed Hannity sticking his neck out on behalf of a first-time politician and sometime Republican who has voiced support for Planned Parenthood while vowing to limit America's military footprint and shred trade deals that the G.O.P. has backed for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hannity's critics on the right have accused him of essentially running hourlong daily </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> infomercials. When I asked him about this, Hannity responded with a well-rehearsed litany of sins perpetrated by the Republican establishment in concert with Obama: perilously low labor participation and homeownership rates, soaring national debt, Obamacare and so on. A Clinton presidency, he warned, would be ''Obama on steroids.'' These were his motivations. ''My conscience is clear. And I feel like Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be a great president.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hannity told me that he had in fact never stayed at a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotel property, played on a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> golf course or visited Mar-a-Lago. ''I have my own place -- on the other Florida coast, in Naples,'' he said. ''I don't need his place. I always got the sense people were asking him for something. I don't believe in asking for free stuff.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nonetheless, the two men have a mutual affinity that has spanned at least two decades. The MSNBC ''Morning Joe'' host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough theorized to me that their relationship has a psychological underpinning: ''Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly all share the same resentment that they will never be accepted into Manhattan's polite society no matter what they do.'' (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is from Queens; Hannity and O'Reilly are from Long Island.) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in a recent phone conversation, offered me a somewhat simpler explanation: ''Sean likes having me on his show, and that has to do with ratings more than anything else.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No presidential candidate in history, Hannity told me, understands television better than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- ''not even close.'' On this score, I couldn't disagree. One evening this past spring, on his plane after a campaign event in Buffalo, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told me that at rallies, he always made a point of finding the TV cameras at the back of the media pen and noticing whether a red light was flickering. ''That means they're airing it live,'' he explained. ''So I make sure to say something new'' -- by which he meant newsworthy, the better to own the next news cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a TV star for more than a decade before he became a politician; he watches TV news incessantly and understands the medium intimately. He knows the optimal time slots on the morning shows. He stage-manages the on-set lighting. He is not only on speaking terms with every network chief executive but also knows their booking agents. He monitors the opinions of hosts and regular guests more avidly than most media critics do and works them obsessively, often directly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Scarborough told me that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family -- particularly Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> husband, Jared Kushner -- sometimes asked him for advice, and more than once ''called me and asked me to get him off the ledge. I've said, 'I can do that, but six hours later he's going to revert to form.' I told Jared at one point: 'Jared, your father-in-law listens to me more when I'm attacking him on television than when I'm trying to convince him to be rational for the sake of the party.' I think he's a creature of TV.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  TV networks, in the mainstream as well as conservative media, have profited handsomely from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election-season theatrics, but some of their on-air personalities like Hannity are drawn to him for reasons apart from ratings. The prospect of getting in on the ground floor of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration that is short on policy ideas and disdainful of old Washington hands amounts to a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. By employing the Breitbart publisher Steve Bannon, and by including both Ingraham and Roger Ailes in his debate preparations, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has implicitly encouraged the conservative media to consider itself part of the campaign team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I asked Hannity if it was true that, as a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> confidant had told me, he wished to be considered as a potential </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White House chief of staff. ''That's news to me,'' he insisted, adding a politician's practiced nondenial denial: ''I have radio and TV contracts that I will honor through December 2020.'' Nonetheless, Hannity's service to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign well exceeds that of ritually bashing Clinton and giving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> free airtime. He has offered private strategic advice to the campaign. The same </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> confidant told me of at least one instance in which Hannity drafted an unsolicited memo outlining the message </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should offer after the Orlando nightclub shooting in June. In public, Hannity has made it his mission to warn fellow conservatives -- naming names, like the columnist Jonah Goldberg and the National Review editor in chief Rich Lowry -- that if they do not soon climb aboard the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> train they will, as the hashtag threatens, #OwnIt: Clinton's picks for the Supreme Court, her response to the Islamic State, her trade deals, all of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hannity maintains that his scolding of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conservative dissenters derives from his fear of a Clinton presidency. ''It'd be pretty much over,'' he said. Taken alone, George Will or even National Review might have little impact on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> standing in the race, Hannity argued, but ''cumulatively they do. I can look at the poll numbers. If you go back to a month ago, he was garnering 73 percent of the Republican vote. The most recent, I think he had 88 percent. He needs to get to 93.'' And the key to the last 5 percent might very well lie with the noisy holdouts, like Erick Erickson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sept. 16, Erickson showed up at the National Press Club in Washington to participate in a debate sponsored by the National Religious Broadcasters. Erickson left RedState at the end of last year to concentrate on his radio show and his online opinion journal, The Resurgent, but he has remained influential among conservatives who do not support </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. In July, when he learned that Ted Cruz was about to have a private meeting with the nominee on the eve of the convention, Erickson texted the senator: ''Don't endorse! Don't endorse!'' Later that evening, Erickson says, Cruz texted back: ''Didn't endorse! Didn't endorse!'' (Cruz finally announced that he would vote for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Sept. 23.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The subject of the debate, inevitably, was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: specifically, whether evangelical Christians should support him. Being a lifelong evangelical himself, Erickson had some thoughts on the matter. Over the years, he had been condemned for his own offensive words, like the time he called the Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis ''Abortion Barbie.'' But he had recently apologized for many (though not all) of these statements and had called upon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to affect a similar posture of Christian humility. ''1 Corinthians is very explicit,'' he told me. ''If someone holds one's self out to be a Christian and doesn't behave that way, Christians are supposed to judge him. This is a guy who's bragged about his affairs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This was Erickson's principal argument during the debate. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was not merely a sinner, he said, but a gleefully unrepentant one. Erickson's debate opponent, the Christian talk-show host and fervent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporter Janet Parshall, responded by reciting a litany of sinners in chief -- from Thomas Jefferson with the out-of-wedlock child he fathered with a slave, to Warren G. Harding with his multiple liaisons, to Richard Nixon with his foul language memorialized on the White House tapes. ''We are not electing a messiah,'' Parshall said. ''Last time I checked, he was appointed to office and he is not term-limited.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Erickson's debating partner, the conservative activist Bill Wichterman, argued that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appealed to the worst in America: His bullying, his lying and his bigotry were ''corrosive to our national character.'' Erickson could testify to this. At one point, he was receiving as many as 300 emails a day from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters. Some of them referred to him as a ''cuck'' or ''cuck-servative.'' The word -- a masculinity-insulting derivative of ''cuckold'' -- was new to Erickson, as were its originators in the white-nationalist alt-right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More than one of the emails predicted that Erickson would be shot to death. At the local grocery store, a man walked up to Erickson's two young children ''and told them they needed to know their father was destroying this country by supporting Hillary Clinton,'' Erickson told me. And one evening, two people showed up on the Ericksons' doorstep to deliver a threat -- Erickson would not tell me what it was -- explicit enough that he later hired security guards. ''I've never had Obama or Romney or McCain or Clinton supporters come to my home or send me nasty letters,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Did </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> beget all of this? If so, what begot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Erickson argued that the fault lay with Beltway Republicans. ''They've broken so many promises,'' he said. ''They promised to defund the president's immigration plan. They promised to defund Obamacare. They promised to fight the president on raising the debt limit. At some point, the base of the party just wants to burn the house down and start over.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even Erickson did not seem convinced that this alone explained what he saw as a nihilistic turn among Republican voters. ''I do think there are a lot of people that have just concluded that this is it -- that if we don't get the election right, the country's over,'' he said. As to where they might have gotten that idea, Erickson knew the answer. It was the apocalyptic hymn sung by talk-radio hosts like his friend and mentor Rush Limbaugh, whose show Erickson once guest-hosted, though in the time of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it seemed unlikely he would receive another invitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This February, Limbaugh, who has applauded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without endorsing him outright, posed to Erickson the question of whether a commentator should try to act as ''the guardian of what it means to be a conservative.'' In effect, the legend of talk radio was laying down an unwritten commandment of the trade, which applies as well to cable TV: Do not attempt to lead your following.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This was simple enough for an avowed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporter like Ingraham. ''Laura's never missed an opportunity to build her career on the backs of others,'' Erickson told me. He counted Hannity as another mentor and admired his entrepreneurial cunning, saying: ''Sean reflects his audience. He's not going to leave his audience.'' On his own radio show, Erickson found that the more he denounced </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the more female listeners he picked up. But most of the 300,000 people who tuned in weekly during rush hour were men. While Erickson refused to abandon his principles, he did not wish to go broke, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sept. 20, Erickson wrote a long post for The Resurgent titled ''Reconsidering My Opposition to Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' He made no effort to disguise his moroseness. ''I see the election of Hillary Clinton as the antithesis of all my values and ideas on what fosters sound civil society in this country,'' he wrote, and described his manifold objections to her at great length. But, he went on, ''I have to admit that while I may view Hillary Clinton's campaign as anti-American, I view Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign as un-American. ... While I see Clinton as having no virtue, I see Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> corrupting the virtuous and fostering hatred, racism and dangerous strains of nationalism.'' The election left him adrift. ''I am without a candidate. I just cannot vote for either one.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And so Erickson's conscience led him back to where he was 13 months ago. Nowadays, he told me, he was doing all he could to avoid discussing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the election altogether -- a tall order for a talk-radio host. Responding to my look of bewilderment, he said, ''Why dwell on the train wreck?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Erickson believed he was not alone. ''People know where we're headed, don't like where we're headed and would rather talk about something else,'' he said. Erickson had won many fights. This one was the biggest yet, and he had lost. There was nothing left to do but step back from his megaphone, dwell on happier matters and wait for the next righteous cause.</SPAN></P>
